# Pathfinder
This is my first experiment with pygame, I made a pathfinding viewer that use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from start (blue square) to end (red square). It is also possible to draw some walls simply dragging on grid.

## How to use it:
- To run it, after you go in the same directory of the project, write in the console: `python3 Pathfinder.py`
- To make walls: drag with cursor on the grid
- To reset the grid with random starting and ending points: press **backspace**
- To execute the algorithm: press **enter**
- To set the mouse position as starting point: press **s**
- To set the mouse position as ending point: press **e**


## How it looks:
